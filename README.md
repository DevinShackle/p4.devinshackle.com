Welcome to Pass It On!

This is the project I built for CSCI E-15 Dynamic Web Applications. Pass It On is focused on 
large organizations and helping their internal communications to be more efficient. Often in 
large technical organizations, workers and technical staff communicate their achievements, 
breakthroughs, and other news up the bureaucratic chain. They can face a diverse audience and, 
as such, are often asked to re-write their texts multiple times. This is extremely inefficient.

Pass It On helps to reduce the time that a technical workforce spends on this activity and 
avoids re-writes by providing a simple interface that allows authors to write their
contribution once, but displays it several different ways depending on the role and account
settings of the reader. These display changes are handled dynamically and are transparent 
to both the authors and the readers.
